# punctuation-detection
Support tools for punctuation and boundary detection for ASR output. Three models are given or pointed to; 
a BERT-based Transformer, a seq2seq Transformer and a bidirectional RNN (Punctuator 2, www.github.com/ottokart/punctuator2)
in Tensorflow 2. Additionally, the code to preprocess text for the use of these models is given in the folder `process`.
